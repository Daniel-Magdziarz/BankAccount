Basic bank account class representing Encapsulation with object oriented programming.

/*Basic bank account class representing Encapsulation with object oriented programming.
This is a basic program simulating a simple bank account. If you use its
interactive menu, you may notice how decimal division in Java can add multiple zeros with a
minuscule number to numerical values. Java has BigDecimal class (not used in this program)
do deal with it. Also, at this time this program serves only one customer at a time. It is
a most basic example of object oriented programming.*/
